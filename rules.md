# X-Team 061 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Split into two groups of two. Each group of two takes a method of choice. 
If we find we need a helper method communicate as a large group and assign the group that needs the helper method to the new method.



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will use group me in order to see how far the other group is and how much the group has left to do before the deadline.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Start projects early
