# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Hello

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will all check in on our group me at one day before the deadline is due to make sure that we are all staying on task and that we are not having any difficulties.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
